<h1>Robocup Software</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
RoboCup Software encompasses all parts of the system that run on a host machine (not the robots). The entire software system is composed of both the components we play soccer and compete with as well as a sort of SDK that allows new components to be written quickly for idea and system testing.
