NAME "test play"

// Normally, the play is restarted when it finishes
// and is selected again by the playbook.
// With this, the play continues with the last roles until
// a different play is selected.
NO_RESTART

// A list of predicates separated by commas.
// All must be true for this play to be selected.
// If REQUIRE is not given, this play may be chosen at any time.
REQUIRE stopped

// Each play has a bias value which can cause one play to be chosen
// over another play whose requirements are all met.
// The bias is the sum of weights of all PREFER predicates.
// If a weight is not given for a predicate, the default of 1.0 is used.
PREFER winning:0.5, always:-10

// Game-state aborts can always end a play.
// If DONE is not given, only those cases apply.
//DONE !offense

// NOT IMPLEMENTED: @object references

// Identifies an opponent by some criteria and assigns him a role name.
// These are handled in order and will not assign two opponents to
// the same role, so another closest_to_ball would
// select the second-closest opponent overall.
OPPONENT @going_to_kick near_ball

// @goalie is our goalie.
// @opp_goalie is the opponent goalie.

ROLE @first
    // NOT IMPLEMENTED:
    // The special tactic "continue" means to continue the previous tactic.
    // This is used if you need to synchronize later and don't want to reset the
    // current tactic.
    
    // Positions can be given with a coordinate system like this:
    //      face=ball:(0,0)
    // Where "ball" is the name of a matrix which transforms the point (0, 0).
